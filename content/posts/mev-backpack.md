### ðŸ‘‹ Greatings Reader!
Interested in MEV but have no clue where to start? â€“ **I will help you gather the things!**

## â›“ Ethereum
First of all, you have to know Ethereum basics, have a wallet, and have some experience with Smart-Contract development.

I would absolutely recommend you [**LearnWeb3.io**](https://learnweb3.io/).

I checked it out personally, and I can assure you, that as soon as you finish **ALL** levels, you can continue your journey.

## ðŸ”¨ Toolings
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- [Your own MEV-Geth Node (at least for start, could be dropped afterwise)](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth)
- [Foundry (optional)](https://getfoundry.sh/)

## ðŸ¤” That's cool, but where is the start, REALLY?
It depends on what kind of MEV are you willing to extract.
Those are:
- Sandwiches
- Liquidations
- Arbitrage
- and many others!

A great start for each of those could be:
- Sandwiches â€“ https://github.com/libevm/subway
- Arbitrage â€“ https://github.com/flashbots/simple-arbitrage
- Liquidations â€“ https://github.com/dydxprotocol/liquidator


In the meantime, interesting and funny posts regarding MEV and ETH as a whole can be found at https://www.libevm.com/

__P.S: If you want to get really quick, I'd advise learning Rust.__
