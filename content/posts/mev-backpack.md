### ðŸ‘‹ Greatings Reader!
Interested in MEV but have no clue where to start? â€“ **I will help you gathering the things!**

## â›“ Ethereum
First off, you of course have to know Ethereum basics, a wallet, and an some experience with Smart-Contract development.

I would absolutely recommend you [**LearnWeb3.io**](https://learnweb3.io/).

I checked it out personally, and I can assure you, as soon as you finish **ALL** levels, you can continue with your journey.

## ðŸ”¨ Toolings
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- [Your own MEV-Geth Node (at least for start, could be dropped afterwise)](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth)
- [Foundry (optional)](https://getfoundry.sh/)

## ðŸ¤” That's cool, but where is the start, REALLY?
In fact, it depends on what kind of MEV are you willing to extract.
There are:
- Sandwiches
- Liquidations
- Arbitrage
- and many others!

A great start for each of those could be:
- Sandwiches â€“ https://github.com/libevm/subway
- Arbitrage â€“ https://github.com/flashbots/simple-arbitrage
- Liquidations â€“ https://github.com/dydxprotocol/liquidator


At the while, an interesting and funny posts can be found at https://www.libevm.com/

__P.S: If you want to get really quick, I'd advise to learn Rust.__
